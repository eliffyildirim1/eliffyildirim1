### Hi there 👋

<!--
**eliffyildirim1/eliffyildirim1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

M.Sc. Student and Data Science Researcher 🪐

I'm Elif from Turkey 🌸I graduated from Karabük University Computer Engineering Department in 2019 as an honor student. I developed an “e-Attendance in Kindergartens” project by using Image processing and Deep Learning techniques in the Undergraduate Project. I'm doing my master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Karabuk University. I took courses on Artificial Neural Networks, Principles of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Thanks to these lessons, I had the opportunity to develop many Artificial Intelligence projects using the ANN, RNN, CNN, LSTM artificial neural network architecture. I was also entitled to participate in the Data Science Bootcamp, which was initiated by the Wtech Women's Association in Technology and Datajarlabs, which lasted for 3 months, by passing the exams and the interview. In this bootcamp, I had the opportunity to carry out projects in the field of applied machine learning on data collection, analysis, data visualization, statistical operations and training-testing. The projects I have done are available in my github repo.  ⚡ 
And I am blogging about Artificial Intelligence. You can follow from this address at https://eliffyildirim1.medium.com/ 💥
